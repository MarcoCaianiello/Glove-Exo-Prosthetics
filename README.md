# Glove-Exo-Prosthetics
## Project Developed @[Icaros-Lab](https://www.icaros.unina.it/)

The aim of the project is to develop an Hand-Shape Exoskeleton to assist a thumb-missing patience with limited hand mobility. The Exoskeleton have to assist the user in the grasp motion. The patient is a 60+ y.o. male, thumb amputee with broken tendons on the remaining fingers. They can be barely moved without hurts the patience. He show problem also at his wrist, he has not a free wrist motion and he cannot put in that too much force.

The Exoskeleton is fully passive and body-powered. We have identified the flexion/extension of the elbow has movement to link with the hand closing/opening. The structure of the device will be compliace to increase the patience comfort while it is wearing. The motion is trasmitted by nylon wire that run through 3D printed tendon guide until the prosthetic thumb, the index and medium finger tip. The tendon guides has been designed to not affect the grasping even if they are placed in iternal part of the hand: palm, finger tips and phalanges. To convert the elbow extension to an hand grasp, we anchor a main tendon on the patience's bicep. A second anchor point, link to the finger tendons is placed on the forearm. In this way, the tendos are pulled when the elbow is extended.

To replace the absence of the thumb, two different designs are proposed. "Thumb whole with hinge" is a one-part thumb, printed using TPU that is using the inner elasticity of TPU to form its joints. "Thumb bottom part" & "thumb top part" are two parts, printed in resin, of a solid thumb and are connected using hinges printed in TPU as joints. Both designs are mounted on a 3d printed splint, that is supposed to hug the back of the hand and offer stability to the prosthetic thumb. The splint and the glove are sewn together. The splint design can be found as "Splint"

To keep the grasp, even when the patient's elbow is flexed, some latching mechanisms are proposed. "Linear latch" has the disadvantage that it needs to be more than double in length compared to the maximum travelling distance. "Rotating latch" needs calibration and scaling to match perfectly the travelling distance of the tendon. An exoskeleton developed by "openbionics" is using a latch mechanism that could be used and can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenBionics/Body-Powered-Exoskeleton-Glove).

### Notes
- The glove must be comfortable and garantee grip during grasping
- The glove can be coated by silicon to increase the grip
- In the grasping movement, the metacarpal flexion has to be included
- The Splint cannot be fully rigid, must introduce a compliance struture to increase the comfort and the fit
- To avoid the interaction of the tendons and the velcro strap used on the Splint, an upgrade could be to eliminate the velcro strap at all on the hand. In this case the thumb will be fixed on the glove.
- The use of a differential, pretension or elastic tendons must be explored to compensate the different finger lengths.


This project is based on this first [prototype](https://github.com/petrokal/ICAROS).
